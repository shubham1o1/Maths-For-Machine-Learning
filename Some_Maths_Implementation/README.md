### Maths for machine learning :
This directory has 5 sub directory which contains python and R codes to implement mathematical concepts. It covers topics from **Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus and Probability Theory**. It is in the form, exactly as it was given in the online course. The course is available on the udemy by the name ["Mathematical Foundation For Machine Learning and AI"](https://www.udemy.com/course/mathematical-foundation-for-machine-learning-and-ai/). The course briefly touches many topics. I found the course to be inspiring and it prepares you to look further into the maths behind the machine learning algorithm.
